44563-01, JASWANTHI NANNURU

 I am a new member of the Spring Batch working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science, came here to update myself with the latest technical knowledge and found Northwest Missouri State University could make me to that extent.

I am from a small town Nalgonda and completed my under graduate degree in 2018 at  Sreyas Institute of Engineering and Technology affliated to JNTUH,Hyderabad,INDIA. I spend my passtime in browsing net trying to know something new.

I am interested in coding and learning the new languages and my hope is to be the part of software company to create new and easily accessible applications that could help everyone.

Apart from course am interested in arts and crafts and playing chess and carroms.
